### Bayeselo is called to output results. "egrep" and "sed are used to modify/control the output text displayed on the screen or sent to text files
### The script code below was derived directly from Robert Hyatt's original "get elo" script - a great example on how to modify text output at the terminal level.
### Thereare lots of little ticks being used here.  Replace with "bayeselo  <<eof" to see how output would look like without any modifcation.
